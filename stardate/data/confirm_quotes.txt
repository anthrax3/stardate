And I'm not the Captain. You are.
Do it, do it, DO IT!
Fire everything!
I am relieved.
I dare you to do better.
IT'LL WORK.
Let's punch it.
Shuttle for new recruits leaves tomorrow morning 0800.
So get some more guys and then it'll be an even fight.
That is so weird.
The wait is over...
Yes, I believe you are.
You got it! Arm phasers. Fire everything we've got!
